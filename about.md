Welcome to my blog, where I'll be reflecting on what I learn by doing small projects in a variety of programming langauges and technologies.

If you are new to programming or would like to revisit some fundamental concepts then this blog is for you.

My posts will be directed on my own personal reflections based on the projects I'm working on, which might in turn help anyone who wants a better grasp on the fundamentals.

The main reason I started this blog is to shake off a bit of rust, due to personal reasons I won't go in now, I had to put programming on the back burner, now I'm back, ready to join the force again. And I thought to myself, why not do it right this time around, by learning, then teaching what I'm learning, and then as a result, learning some more. :)
