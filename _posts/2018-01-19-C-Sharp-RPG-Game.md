### General info on C# #
	* C# is case sensitive
    	- When you name anything in C# (class, variable, funtions, ect.), the casing you use is important. Customer is different from custumer and CUSTUMER, as long as you are consistent, it does not matter what you use. However, a lot of C# programmers have standard naming conventions, and it will be wise to get used to them earlier on, for you to read programs, and let other programmers read yours with ease.
    * C# is a higher level langauge
    * Functions, Procedures, Methods
    * Compiling and building
