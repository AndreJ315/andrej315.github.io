## Starting my first Learning Project - C# #
For my first project I'll be creating a C# RPG game from sctatch with Visual Studio 2017

### Purpose for starting this project:
To learn the Fundamentals of C#

### What will be learned?
	* Creating Classes
    * Handling user inputs
    * Doing common calculations

### General info on C# #
	* C# is case sensitive
When you name anything in C# (class, variable, funtions, ect.), the casing you use is important. Customer is different from custumer and CUSTUMER, as long as you are consistent, it does not matter what you use. However, a lot of C# programmers have standard naming conventions, and it will be wise to get used to them earlier on, for you to read programs, and let other programmers read yours with ease.
    * C# is a higher level langauge
Basically it means C# looks simular to natural english to a certain level. Whereas lower level langauges are more readily understood by machines. 
    * Functions, Procedures, Methods
These are names we use to describe small programs that does a specific thing.
    * Compiling and building
For a C# program to run on a computer, the program needs to be converted into something a computer can read. This process is called compiling.
